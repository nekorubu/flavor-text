# nekobu's Flavor Text

A little project meant to play around with and learn REST APIs by building something personally useful to me. Still a work in progress.

The API is hosted at [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and is available at [ft.asoulless.space/api/flavor](https://ft.asoulless.space/api/flavor) and [flavor-text.vercel.app/api/flavor](https://flavor-text.vercel.app/api/flavor).

# AI Disclosure
Given the controversial nature of generative AI and it's usage, I want to try and be transparent about how I'm using generative AI for this project.

I've made use of [Claude](https://claude.ai) to help with debugging and trying to get the API up and running. I've made sure to try and describe how it was used to help me with each file.
